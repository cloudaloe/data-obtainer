; This is a configuration file detailing the databases to poll and their access details.
; Each database has its own {} clause, you can have as many as you like.
; You need both the network (firewall) and MySQL to permit access from the server where this is running.
;
; FOR GETTING STARTED, start with just one or two databases. You can later freely add or change as you like, without any necessary ceremony.
; Although the program will inform you of connection problem details if any, it would make sense to first manually test the connection.
