This program attempts to pull meta-data from your MySQL databases.
It attempts to pull meta-data for all databases supplied inside databases/databases.cfg. This implies that the network and databases should permit a connection using those connection details supplied there.

In case this program fails to pull data from any database, please manually confirm that you are able to 1) Connect to that database using the connection parameters supplied in databases/databases.cfg and 2) That you are able to query table 'tables' under schema 'information_schema' after making the connection.
